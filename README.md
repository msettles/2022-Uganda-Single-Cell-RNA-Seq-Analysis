Contact - Dr. Matthew Settles

This five-day remote workshop covers experimental design, data generation, and analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data. Participants will explore a single cell experiment using the command line and R, create and modify workflows, and diagnose and treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. The primary packages used for analysis will be 10x software for sequence reads to counts, and the R package Seurat for downstream analysis.
