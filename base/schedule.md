## Daily task list and todos

The materials are still evolving, while you can continue on ahead, you may need to backtrack and redo some materials as I may have changed them.

### Monday, July 18

Monday's goal is introductions, setup and prerequisites

My intro Day 1 [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/FSN4NEuw_Ug)

1. Introduce yourselves to each other and to the instructors.
1. Post an introduction of yourself onto the [Discussion Page](https://github.com/msettles/2022-Uganda-S.ngle-Cell-RNA-Seq-Analysis/discussions).
1. Read over the [welcome](./welcome) page (Very Short).
1. If needed install the **most** current versions of R **AND** RStudio, please do so.
1. Review the [UCD Intro to R course](https://ucdavis-bioinformatics-training.github.io/2022-April-Introduction-to-R-for-Bioinformatics/).
  - this course is a 1.5-day course, however the intent here is to review the materials and not do everything.
  - I assume you all have experience and if anything just need a refresher.
1. Perform the ["scRNAseq Analysis"](../data_analysis/scrna_analysis_prepare) section. Prepare your RStudio environment, install R packages and retrieve the data for data analysis.
1. Read the Paper [Becker et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01088-x), the data is based on.

### Tuesday, July 19

1. Look at the raw data folder and its contents
